ðŸ“„ PRD: Playlist â†’ Notion Automation Workflow

Overview

We want to automate the capture of tracks added by the music supervisor into Apple Music and Spotify playlists, and automatically create structured records in a Notion database. The workflow should capture as much metadata as possible, while staying flexible to API limitations and mapping inconsistencies.

â¸»

Objectives
	â€¢	Automatically sync new playlist entries from Spotify and Apple Music into Notion.
	â€¢	Capture metadata: track title, artist, album, release year, duration, publisher/label, ISRC/UPC (if available), playlist name, and type (Source/Temp).
	â€¢	Store Spotify and Apple Music URLs together in the same URL property in Notion.
	â€¢	Prevent duplicates (prefer ISRC as unique key).
	â€¢	Allow human tagging and annotation in Notion (themes, notes, instruments, mood, record date).
	â€¢	Run serverlessly on GitHub Actions, with configuration via .env.

â¸»

Flexibility Note
	â€¢	APIs for Spotify and Apple Music differ. Some fields (e.g., Composer vs. Artist, Label metadata) may not map perfectly or may be missing.
	â€¢	The workflow should remain flexible: if metadata is missing, insert what is available, log the gap, and allow future enrichment.

Users
	â€¢	Primary: Music Supervisor â€” keeps adding tracks to playlists.
	â€¢	Secondary: Producers/Researchers â€” reference the Notion database.

Technical Design

Spotify
	â€¢	Auth via Client ID + Secret + Refresh Token.
	â€¢	Needs playlist-read-private scope.
	â€¢	Playlist ID comes from playlist URL (https://open.spotify.com/playlist/{playlistId}).

Apple Music
	â€¢	Requires both:
	â€¢	Developer Token â†’ generated from TEAM_ID, KEY_ID, and .p8 private key.
	â€¢	Music User Token â†’ generated once by logging in with Apple Music account.
	â€¢	Playlist ID comes from Apple Music URL (https://music.apple.com/.../playlist/{playlistId}).
	â€¢	Storefront required (e.g. us, gb, tr).

Notion
	â€¢	Use Notion API with integration key.
	â€¢	Database fields:
	â€¢	Automatable: Track Title, Track Number, Album, Artist, Performed By, Release Date, Duration, Label/Publisher, ISRC/UPC, URL, Playlist, Type, Created Time.
	â€¢	Manual: Record Date, Composer (Spotify), Themes, Notes, Instruments, Mood.

Environment Setup
	â€¢	.env file must include:

NOTION_KEY=xxx
NOTION_DB_ID=xxx

SPOTIFY_CLIENT_ID=xxx
SPOTIFY_CLIENT_SECRET=xxx
SPOTIFY_REFRESH_TOKEN=xxx
SPOTIFY_PLAYLIST_ID=xxx

APPLE_MUSIC_TEAM_ID=xxx
APPLE_MUSIC_KEY_ID=xxx
APPLE_MUSIC_PRIVATE_KEY="-----BEGIN PRIVATE KEY-----\nMIGT...\n-----END PRIVATE KEY-----"
APPLE_MUSIC_USER_TOKEN=xxx
APPLE_MUSIC_PLAYLIST_ID=xxx
APPLE_MUSIC_STOREFRONT=us


	â€¢	.p8 file can live at project root for dev, but the private key text in .env is enough.
